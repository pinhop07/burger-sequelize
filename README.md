# Eat-Da-Burger

### Overview

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Eat Da Burger 2: The Sequel!

Allows the user to log the burgers they would like to eat.  The user can also select a temperature for the burger to be cooked that will be stored in a seperate table from the burger.
